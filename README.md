**Website Performance Analysis Using Sitespeed.io**

Sitespeed.io is an open-source tool that analyzes website performance by simulating user interactions across various pages. It gathers detailed metrics on speed, accessibility, best practices, and user experience. Sitespeed.io integrates with various tools, such as Google Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and PageSpeed Insights, making it a comprehensive solution for performance monitoring and optimization.

Key Features of Sitespeed.io:
Performance Testing: Measures page load times, JavaScript execution, and rendering.
Web Vitals Monitoring: Tracks Core Web Vitals like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
Automation: Supports continuous performance testing as part of CI/CD pipelines.
Data Export and Visualization: Integrates with Grafana to visualize performance trends over time.


Project Scope and Implementation
1. Performance Testing Setup
Configured Sitespeed.io to evaluate critical pages on the website, assessing factors such as:

Page Load Time
1.Time to Interactive (TTI)
2.First Contentful Paint (FCP)
3.JavaScript and CSS Optimization

2. Integrating Sitespeed.io in CI/CD Pipeline
To ensure performance remains consistent with new updates, Sitespeed.io was integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, enabling automated testing on every code deployment. This setup allowed:

Early detection of performance regressions.
Automated alerts for any significant drops in speed or user experience metrics.
Continuous monitoring to maintain performance goals.
3. Visualizing and Monitoring Results in Grafana
Collected performance data from Sitespeed.io and stored it in a time-series database like Graphite.
Connected Grafana for real-time visualization of trends, enabling:
Quick identification of high-impact performance issues.
Tracking improvements over time and validating optimizations.
